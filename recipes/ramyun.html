    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Shin ramen</li>
        <li>bacon strips</li>
        <li>green onion</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>egg</li>
        <li>cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Steps</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan, add the bacon strips and cook over medium-high heat for 1 minute or until they are almost cooked. If the bacon doesn't release enough oil, you can add a little bit of cooking oil.</li>
        <li>Once the bacon has released some oil, add the white part of the green onion and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Set the bacon and green onions aside.</li>
        <li>Return the pan to the heat and add 2 ½ cups of water. Bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, add the Shin Ramen noodles, dried vegetable packet, and 1 tbsp of the seasoning packet (adjust according to how spicy you want it).</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles for 4-5 minutes until they are fully cooked and tender.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat to low. Create a well in the center of the noodles and crack the egg into it. Place the cheese slice halves on both sides of the egg.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a lid and continue cooking for about 1-2 minutes or until the cheese has melted, and the egg whites are cooked. The yolk can be runny or cooked to your preference.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the green part of the green onion.</li>
        <li>Serve the Shin Ramyun with the egg and cheese immediately while it's still hot.</li>
    </ol>
